    <h1>Hinduism</h1>
    <p><img src="hindu.jpeg" width="162" height="181" align="right" />Hinduism is the dominant religion of the Indian subcontinent, particularly of India and Nepal, which consists of many diverse traditions.
       It includes Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism among numerous other traditions, and a wide spectrum of laws and prescriptions of "daily morality" based on karma, dharma, and societal norms.
       Hinduism is a categorisation of distinct intellectual or philosophical points of view, rather than a rigid, common set of beliefs.</p>
    <p>Hinduism has been called the "oldest religion" in the world, and many practitioners refer to Hinduism as "the eternal law" or the "eternal way" (SanƒÅtana Dharma).
       Nevertheless, it is a fusion or synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots and no single founder.
       Among its roots are the Vedic religion of the late Vedic period and its emphasis on the status of Brahmans, but also the religions of the Indus Valley Civilisation, the Sramana or renouncer traditions of north-east India, and "popular or local traditions".
       This "Hindu synthesis" emerged around the beginning of the Common Era, and co-existed for several centuries with Buddhism, to finally gain the upperhand in most royal circles during the 8th century CE.</p>
